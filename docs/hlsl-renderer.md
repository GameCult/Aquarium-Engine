# HLSL Renderer

Aquarium now has a first shader-owned image path.

## Current Path

- `D3D11Renderer` compiles `Render/Shaders/Aquarium.hlsl` at startup with
  `Vortice.D3DCompiler`.
- The renderer draws one fullscreen triangle.
- The pixel shader raymarches the Grid heightfield, Self sun, and orbiting
  planets.
- C# feeds only frame constants: resolution, time, Grid radius, and camera
  position.
- CultMath is referenced as the CPU-side math grammar. Vortice math stays at the
  graphics API membrane.

## Current Limits

This is still a first image path, not the final renderer. The shader keeps
planet broad-phase cheap by avoiding terrain samples inside every planet anchor.
Terrain-hugging orbit cups should come back through a real object table or
precomputed frame constants, not repeated procedural work inside every SDF
sample. That was the tiny furnace. It has been told to sit down.
